Data Augmentation:

Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset and improve the model's generalization.

Applied transformations such as rotation, width shift, height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip.

Model Architecture:

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.

Added batch normalization layers after each convolutional and dense layer to stabilize and accelerate training.

Included dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Early Stopping and Model Checkpoint:

Used early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss and stopping training when it stops improving.

Saved the best model during training using model checkpointing.

Learning Rate Scheduler:

Implemented a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training, improving convergence.

Transfer Learning:

Utilized a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16) and fine-tuned it on your dataset to leverage existing knowledge and improve performance.

Training and Visualization:

Trained the model using the augmented dataset and applied the callbacks for early stopping, model checkpointing, and learning rate reduction.

Visualized the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs using plots.
